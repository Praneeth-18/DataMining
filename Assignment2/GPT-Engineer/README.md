Assumptions:

1. The application will be compatible with Windows 7 and above.
2. The GUI will be simple and user-friendly, with a clean and modern design.
3. The scientific calculator will include functions for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, logarithms, exponentials, square roots, and factorials.
4. The application will not include any additional features or functionalities beyond the scientific calculator.
5. The timeline for the project is not specified, so the focus will be on creating a high-quality application rather than rushing to meet a specific deadline.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:

1. `Calculator`: This is the main class for the calculator. It will include methods for each of the scientific functions.
2. `GUI`: This class will handle the graphical user interface for the application.
3. `main`: This function will serve as the entry point for the application.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
